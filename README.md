# Notes from recap lecture

## Statistics

* Standard Error and Confidence Intervals
	- Explain the formular
* Sample size calculation
	- Explain the formular
* Correlation and causality
	- Difference between the two and why it's important
* Experimental Design
	- Use in 3-week project, argue for design in project

## Algorithms
Be able to explain and use the following algorithms

* Algorithmic complexity
	- Big-O-notation
	- Time-function
	- Upper bound and growth rate
* K-means clustering
* Least Squares Regression
* Neural Networks (Seems hard, when Mikkel speaks about it)
	- Cost Function
	- Network Structure
	- Model Parameters
	- Derivatives 
* Okapi BM25
	- Weighing document relevance based on search query

## Machine Learning

* Ethics
	- Lecture with Pernille Tranberg
	- Essay, if relevant
	- Use in report, but not too much
* Unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning
	- Unsupervised and supervised are expected for us to know
		* We must be able to implement and use these
	- Reinforcement learning
		* Still complex, need to understand it, but not implement
* Training and Test Error
* Feature transformation: Scaling and basis change
We need to think about and include this in the project and report
	- Min-max normalization
	- Standardization
	- Basis change
	

## Optimization

* Cost function and parameter estimation
	- Gradient decent used for error measure to adjust algorithm
		* We can create an algorithm and cost function to use in the machine learning project
* Gradient Decent
	- We are expected to know this
* Automatic differentiation
	- Is categorized as simple by Mikkel (We must know this for the exam)

## Data

* Image Analysis
	- Color Spaces (RGB, LAB space)
* Audio data
	- Spectrogram
		1. Splitting signal into blocks
		2. Computer spectrum for each block
		3. Gather all blocks in a plot
* Bag of words
	- Also checkout n-grams another algorithm

## Tools

* Git
	- Use for the project
* LaTeX
	- We must write our report in LaTex
* IMRaD
	- We must use this model for structuring our report
* Abstract
	- 5-sentence abstract
		* Motivation
			- Why do we care?
		* Problem
			- What problem will we solve? What have others done, and why is that not enough?
		* Approach
			- What is our big idea? How did we solve it? Which research, analysis, and experiments did we do?
		* Results
			- What is the answer?
		* Conclusions
			- What are the implications
